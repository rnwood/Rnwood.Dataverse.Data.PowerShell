# SetDataverseRecordCmdlet Refactoring Status

## Objective
Apply PR #137 refactoring pattern to SetDataverseRecordCmdlet

## What PR #137 Did
- Reduced RemoveDataverseRecordCmdlet from ~470 to ~145 lines
- Moved logic into DeleteOperationContext
- Made cmdlet a thin orchestration layer
- Pattern: Context owns request creation and execution

## Progress Made (9 commits)
### Infrastructure (Commits 1-4)
✅ Created ISetOperationParameters interface
✅ Created SetOperationContext class with delegates
✅ Created SetBatchProcessor class
✅ Wired up lifecycle (BeginProcessing, EndProcessing, StopProcessing)
✅ Added CancellationTokenSource support

### Code Extraction (Commits 5-9)
✅ Extracted 7 utility methods to context:
  - GetKeySummary, GetColumnSummary, Ellipsis, GetValueSummary
  - RemoveUnchangedColumns
  - ApplyBypassBusinessLogicExecution
  - SetIdProperty
✅ Extracted 1 constant: DontUpdateDirectlyColumnNames
✅ Replaced 5 duplicate code blocks
✅ All 55 tests passing throughout

## Current State
**File Structure:**
- Lines 1-540: Context and Processor classes (infrastructure complete)
- Lines 540-2203: SetDataverseRecordCmdlet class (~1663 lines)

**Cmdlet Status:**
- Infrastructure: ✅ Complete (matches PR #137)
- Business Logic: ❌ Still in cmdlet (needs migration)

## Remaining Work: The "Big Final Refactor"
To match PR #137 pattern, need to move **~1500 lines** from cmdlet to context:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Methods (~400 lines)
- GetConversionOptions → Context
- NeedsRetrieval → Context
- GetExistingRecord → Context
- ProcessQueuedRecords → Context or Processor

### Phase 2: Main Operation Flow (~600 lines)
- ProcessSingleRecord → Context.ProcessOperation()
- UpsertRecord → Context method
- CreateNewRecord → Context method
- UpdateExistingRecord → Context method
- ProcessRecordWithExistingRecord → Context method

### Phase 3: Specialized Operations (~300 lines)
- Associate/Disassociate M:M logic → Context
- Assign logic → Context
- SetState logic → Context

### Phase 4: Handlers (~200 lines)
- All *Completion methods → Context
- All *Error methods → Context
- RetryRecord management → Processor

### Phase 5: Cmdlet Simplification
- ProcessRecord becomes ~10 lines (create context, delegate)
- EndProcessing calls processor flush/retry
- Remove all business logic from cmdlet

## Complexity Factors
1. **Scale:** 3.5x larger than RemoveDataverseRecord before refactoring
2. **Operations:** 8 operation types vs 1 (Delete only)
3. **State:** Complex state management across retrieval batching
4. **Callbacks:** 8 callback invocation points to replace
5. **Testing:** Must validate all operation paths

## Why This is Multi-Day Work
- Each phase requires ~4-6 hours
- Total estimated effort: 20-30 hours
- Risk: High (core business logic migration)
- Testing: Extensive (all 8 operation types)

## What's Ready
✅ Foundation is solid
✅ Pattern is clear  
✅ Tests exist for validation
✅ Infrastructure matches PR #137
✅ Incremental approach defined

## Recommendation
Complete the refactoring in dedicated sessions:
1. Phase 1-2: 8-10 hours
2. Phase 3-4: 8-10 hours  
3. Phase 5 + testing: 4-6 hours
4. Total: 20-26 hours of focused work

Each phase should be a separate commit/PR for safety.
