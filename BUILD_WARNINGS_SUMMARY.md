## Remaining Warnings (Not Actionable - Package Compatibility)

**Total remaining warnings:** 23

### NuGet Package Compatibility Warnings (NU1701)
- **Count:** 20 warnings
- **Description:** Packages restored using .NET Framework instead of .NET 6.0
- **Affected packages:**
  - MarkMpn.Sql4Cds.Engine 10.1.0
  - Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies 9.0.2.49
  - Microsoft.CrmSdk.Deployment 9.0.2.25
  - Microsoft.CrmSdk.Workflow 9.0.2.42
  - Microsoft.CrmSdk.XrmTooling.CoreAssembly 9.1.1.32
- **Impact:** Informational only - these packages work correctly but don't have .NET 6.0-specific versions
- **Recommendation:** No action needed. These are Microsoft's CRM SDK packages that are .NET Framework-based but compatible with .NET 6.0 through .NET Standard support.

### Project Reference Compatibility Warning (NU1702)
- **Count:** 1 warning
- **Description:** Rnwood.Dataverse.Data.PowerShell.Loader resolved using .NET Framework 4.6.2 instead of .NET Standard 2.0
- **Impact:** Informational only - the project is multi-targeted and works correctly
- **Recommendation:** No action needed. This is expected behavior for multi-targeted projects.

### MSBuild Assembly Reference Warnings (MSB3277)
- **Count:** 2 warnings
- **Description:** Multiple versions of the same assembly causing reference conflicts
- **Impact:** Build system resolves these automatically
- **Recommendation:** No action needed. These are informational warnings from the build system about how it resolves assembly conflicts.

## Conclusion

All XML comment warnings have been successfully resolved. The remaining 23 warnings are package compatibility and build system warnings that are:
1. Informational only
2. Do not indicate actual problems
3. Cannot be eliminated without upgrading third-party dependencies (which is outside the scope)
4. Already partially suppressed in the .csproj file (warnings 1701, 1702 are listed in NoWarn)

The build is clean of all actionable XML documentation warnings.
