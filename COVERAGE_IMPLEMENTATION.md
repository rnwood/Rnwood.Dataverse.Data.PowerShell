# Test Coverage Implementation Summary

## Objective
Add CI test coverage reporting that posts coverage information to pull requests, showing coverage on a per-cmdlet basis with delta from the base branch.

## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

### Files Created
1. **scripts/Generate-TestCoverageReport.ps1** (292 lines)
   - Discovers all cmdlets in the repository
   - Runs Pester test suite
   - Matches tests to cmdlets
   - Generates markdown and JSON reports
   - Supports baseline comparison

2. **scripts/README.md** (70 lines)
   - Usage documentation
   - CI integration details
   - Coverage calculation explanation

### Files Modified
1. **.github/workflows/publish.yml**
   - Added `test-coverage` job (runs on PR events)
   - Builds module and runs tests
   - Generates baseline from base branch
   - Compares PR coverage with baseline
   - Posts results as PR comment

2. **.gitignore**
   - Added `coverage/` directory

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Cmdlet Discovery
- Discovers **all 383 cmdlets** in the repository
- Handles two cmdlet attribute patterns:
  - `[Cmdlet(VerbsCommon.Get, "DataverseRecord")]` - manual cmdlets
  - `[Cmdlet("Invoke", "DataverseAddAppComponents")]` - auto-generated SDK cmdlets

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis
- Runs full Pester test suite (~275 tests)
- Matches test names/paths to cmdlet names
- Determines which cmdlets have test coverage
- Calculates coverage percentage: (tested cmdlets / total cmdlets) √ó 100

### 3. Baseline Comparison
- Saves coverage script before checking out base branch
- Generates baseline coverage from base branch
- Handles cases where script doesn't exist on base
- Shows delta with visual indicators:
  - üìà Coverage increased
  - üìâ Coverage decreased
  - ‚û°Ô∏è Coverage unchanged

### 4. PR Integration
- Automatically runs on PR open/reopen/synchronize
- Posts coverage report as comment
- Updates existing comment on subsequent pushes
- Uploads coverage artifacts for review

## Report Format

The PR comment includes:

```markdown
# üìä Code Coverage Report

## Summary
- **Cmdlet Coverage**: 2.87% (üìà +0.26% from base)
- **Cmdlets with Tests**: 11 / 383
- **Total Tests**: 275
- **Test Results**: ‚úÖ 275 passed, ‚ùå 0 failed

## ‚úÖ Cmdlets with Tests (11)
| Cmdlet | Test Count | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Get-DataverseConnection | 45 tests | ‚úÖ All passed |
| Get-DataverseRecord | 89 tests | ‚úÖ All passed |
...

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cmdlets without Tests (372)
| Cmdlet | Class Name |
|--------|------------|
| Compare-DataverseSolutionComponents | CompareDataverseSolutionComponentsCmdlet |
...
```

## Technical Approach

### Why Cmdlet-Level Coverage?
- **Practical**: Shows which cmdlets have ANY tests vs none
- **No Instrumentation**: Doesn't require C# code coverage tools
- **Fast**: Uses existing Pester infrastructure
- **Actionable**: Easy to identify untested cmdlets

### Alternative Considered: Line-Level Coverage
- Would require coverlet or similar .NET coverage tool
- More complex integration with PowerShell tests
- Slower execution
- More difficult to interpret for large codebase
- Decided cmdlet-level is better starting point

## CI/CD Integration

### Workflow: test-coverage
- **Trigger**: PR opened, reopened, or synchronized
- **Permissions**: contents:read, pull-requests:write
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout with full history
  2. Install PowerShell latest
  3. Build module
  4. Generate PR coverage
  5. Generate baseline coverage (continue-on-error)
  6. Compare with baseline if available
  7. Post/update PR comment
  8. Upload artifacts

## Security & Quality

### Security Scan
- ‚úÖ CodeQL analysis passed (0 alerts)
- Uses GitHub Actions best practices
- Temp files in `$env:RUNNER_TEMP`
- No secrets or credentials needed

### Code Review
- ‚úÖ All feedback addressed
- Proper error handling
- Clear documentation
- Follows PowerShell conventions

## Testing

### Validation Performed
1. ‚úÖ Cmdlet discovery: 393 files found, 383 cmdlets discovered
2. ‚úÖ Pattern matching: Both VerbsXxx.Verb and string literal patterns work
3. ‚úÖ Script exists and is executable
4. ‚úÖ YAML syntax is valid
5. ‚úÖ Workflow has proper structure (2 jobs)

### Not Tested (Requires CI Environment)
- [ ] Full workflow execution in GitHub Actions
- [ ] PR comment posting
- [ ] Baseline comparison in real PR
- [ ] Artifact upload

## Next Steps

1. **Verify CI Execution**: Check that workflow runs successfully on this PR
2. **Review Coverage Report**: Examine the PR comment for accuracy
3. **Iterate if Needed**: Make adjustments based on first real run
4. **Monitor**: Watch for issues in future PRs

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Remove `test-coverage` job from workflow
2. Revert to previous workflow version
3. Coverage script remains for local use

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Line-level code coverage for C# cmdlets
- Coverage trends over time
- Coverage badges in README
- Coverage requirements/thresholds
- Integration with coverage services (Codecov, Coveralls)
