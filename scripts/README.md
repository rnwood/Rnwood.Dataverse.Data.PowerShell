# Coverage Scripts

## Run-TestsWithCoverage.ps1

Runs tests with code coverage using coverlet.console to instrument the cmdlets DLL. This provides line-level and branch-level coverage for C# cmdlet code.

### How It Works

1. **Build**: Builds the project without instrumentation
2. **Copy**: Copies the built module to the `out` directory
3. **Instrument**: Uses coverlet.console to instrument the cmdlets DLL in the `out` directory
4. **Test Execution**: Runs Pester tests which load the instrumented DLL
5. **Coverage Collection**: Coverlet tracks which lines and branches are executed
6. **Report Generation**: Parses Cobertura XML to create per-cmdlet coverage report

The key insight is that tests copy the module to a temp directory, so we instrument the DLL in the `out` directory before tests run. When tests copy from `out` to temp, they copy the instrumented DLL.

### Usage

```powershell
# Basic usage (handles build and test)
./scripts/Run-TestsWithCoverage.ps1

# With custom output directory
./scripts/Run-TestsWithCoverage.ps1 -OutputDir "my-coverage"

# With baseline comparison
./scripts/Run-TestsWithCoverage.ps1 -BaselineCoverageFile "baseline.json"
```

### Requirements

- .NET SDK
- PowerShell 7+
- Pester 5.0+
- coverlet.console (auto-installed)

### Output Files

- `coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml` - Cobertura format (standard for coverage tools)
- `coverage/coverage.json` - JSON format
- `coverage/coverage-report.md` - Markdown report with per-cmdlet breakdown
- `coverage/coverage-data.json` - Simplified JSON for baseline comparison

### Coverage Metrics

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of executable lines that were executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of decision points (if/else, switch, etc.) that were executed  
- **Per-Cmdlet**: Coverage broken down by each cmdlet class

### CI Integration

The script is integrated into `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and runs automatically on pull requests to:
1. Build the project
2. Instrument the cmdlets DLL with coverlet.console
3. Run tests (coverage tracked automatically)
4. Get baseline coverage from base branch
5. Compare and show delta
6. Post report as PR comment

### Exclusions

The following are excluded from coverage:
- `[GeneratedCode]` attributed code
- `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` attributed code
- FakeXrmEasy test framework code
- Test assemblies

### Report Format

```markdown
# üìä Code Coverage Report

## Overall Coverage
- **Line Coverage**: 45.2% (üìà +2.1% from base)
- **Branch Coverage**: 38.5%
- **Lines Covered**: 1234 / 2731

## Coverage by Cmdlet
| Cmdlet | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Lines |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è `Get-DataverseRecord` | 65.3% | 52.1% | 234 / 358 |
| ‚úÖ `Set-DataverseRecord` | 82.4% | 71.2% | 412 / 500 |
...
```

Indicators:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Low coverage (<30%)
- ‚ö° Medium coverage (30-60%)
- ‚úÖ Good coverage (>60%)
