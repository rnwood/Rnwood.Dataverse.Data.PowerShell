# Get-DataverseConnection

## SYNOPSIS
Gets a connection to a Dataverse environment either interactively or silently and returns it.

All commands that need a connection to Dataverse expect you to provide the connection in `-connection` parameter.
So you can store the output of this command in a variable and pass it to each command that needs it.
See the examples for this pattern below.

## DESCRIPTION

This cmdlet establishes a connection to a Microsoft Dataverse environment which can then be used with other cmdlets in this module.

All commands that need a connection to Dataverse expect you to provide the connection in `-connection` parameter.
So you can store the output of this command in a variable and pass it to each command that needs it.
See the examples for this pattern below.

Multiple authentication methods are supported:
- Interactive authentication (browser-based)
- Device code flow (for remote/headless scenarios)
- Username/password
- Client secret (for service principal authentication)
- Client certificate (for certificate-based service principal authentication)
- DefaultAzureCredential (automatic credential discovery for Azure environments)
- ManagedIdentityCredential (for Azure managed identity authentication)
- Connection string (for advanced scenarios)
- PAC CLI profile (leverages existing Power Platform CLI authentication)
- Mock connection (for testing)
- Access token script block (for custom authentication scenarios)

Connections can be saved with names for later reuse, with optional credential persistence (not recommended for production).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -Interactive
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using interactive authentication and stores the result in the `$c` variable for later use.

### Example 2
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -url "https://myorg.crm4.dynamics.com" -clientid "3004eb1e-7a00-45e0-a1dc-6703735eac18" -clientsecret "itsasecret"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using Service Principal client ID and secret auth and stores the result in the `$c` variable for later use.

### Example 2b
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -clientid "3004eb1e-7a00-45e0-a1dc-6703735eac18" -clientsecret "itsasecret"
```

Authenticates with client ID and secret without specifying a URL. The cmdlet will use the service principal credentials to discover available environments, then you can select which environment to connect to. Both discovery and the final connection use the same client secret authentication.

### Example 3
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -DefaultAzureCredential
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using DefaultAzureCredential, which automatically discovers credentials from the environment (environment variables, managed identity, Visual Studio, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or interactive browser). This is ideal for Azure-hosted applications.

### Example 4
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ManagedIdentity
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using the system-assigned managed identity. This is useful when running in Azure environments like Azure Functions, App Service, or VMs with managed identity enabled.

### Example 5
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ManagedIdentity -ManagedIdentityClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using a user-assigned managed identity with the specified client ID.

### Example 6
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Interactive
```

Authenticates interactively without specifying a URL. The cmdlet will automatically display a list of available Dataverse environments for the user to select from. This is useful when you have access to multiple environments and don't want to manually specify the URL.

### Example 7
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -AccessToken { "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Im5PbzNaRHJ1VW1sMGhrR2ZaRjBqZWFHWW9XQT..." }
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using a script block that returns an access token. The script block is called whenever a new access token is needed. This is useful for custom authentication scenarios where you manage token acquisition externally.

### Example 8
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificatePath "C:\certs\mycert.pfx" -CertificatePassword "P@ssw0rd"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using client certificate authentication with a certificate file. The certificate file is password-protected.

### Example 9
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificateThumbprint "A1B2C3D4E5F6789012345678901234567890ABCD"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using client certificate authentication with a certificate from the Windows certificate store (CurrentUser\My by default).

### Example 10
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificateThumbprint "A1B2C3D4E5F6789012345678901234567890ABCD" -CertificateStoreLocation LocalMachine -CertificateStoreName Root
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using client certificate authentication with a certificate from the LocalMachine\Root certificate store.

### Example 11
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificatePath "./mycert.pfx"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using client certificate authentication with an unencrypted certificate file (no password required).

### Example 11b
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificatePath "./mycert.pfx"
```

Authenticates with client certificate without specifying a URL. The cmdlet will use the certificate credentials to discover available environments, then you can select which environment to connect to. Both discovery and the final connection use the same client certificate authentication.

### Example 12: Save a named connection
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -Interactive -Name "MyOrgProd"
```

Connects to MYORG using interactive authentication and saves the connection with the name "MyOrgProd". The authentication tokens will be cached securely, and connection metadata will be saved for later use.

### Example 13: Load a saved named connection
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Name "MyOrgProd"
```

Loads the previously saved connection named "MyOrgProd". The cmdlet will use the cached authentication tokens, avoiding the need to authenticate again unless the tokens have expired.

### Example 14: List all saved connections
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -ListConnections
```

Lists all saved named connections, showing their names, URLs, authentication methods, usernames, and when they were last saved.

### Example 15: Delete a saved connection
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -DeleteConnection -Name "MyOrgProd"
```

Deletes the saved connection named "MyOrgProd", removing both the connection metadata and cached authentication tokens.

### Example 16: Save connection with client secret
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "3004eb1e-7a00-45e0-a1dc-6703735eac18" -ClientSecret "itsasecret" -Name "MyOrgService"
```

Connects using client secret authentication and saves the connection as "MyOrgService". Note: The client secret itself is NOT saved for security reasons. When loading this connection later, you will need to provide the client secret again.

### Example 17: Save connection with credentials encrypted (NOT RECOMMENDED)
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "3004eb1e-7a00-45e0-a1dc-6703735eac18" -ClientSecret "itsasecret" -Name "MyOrgService" -SaveCredentials
```

Saves the connection with the client secret included (encrypted). WARNING: This stores the secret encrypted on disk and is NOT RECOMMENDED for production use. Only use for testing or non-production scenarios. On Windows, uses DPAPI (Data Protection API); on Linux/macOS, uses AES encryption with machine-specific key.

### Example 18: Save certificate connection with credentials encrypted (NOT RECOMMENDED)
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc" -CertificatePath "C:\certs\mycert.pfx" -CertificatePassword "P@ssw0rd" -Name "MyCertConn" -SaveCredentials
```

Saves the connection with certificate path and password included (encrypted). WARNING: This stores the password encrypted on disk and is NOT RECOMMENDED for production use. Only use for testing or non-production scenarios.

### Example 19: Save username/password connection with credentials encrypted (NOT RECOMMENDED)
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -Username "user@domain.com" -Password "mypassword" -Name "MyUserConn" -SaveCredentials
```

Saves the connection with the password included (encrypted). WARNING: This stores the password encrypted on disk and is NOT RECOMMENDED for production use. Only use for testing or non-production scenarios.

### Example 20: Clear all saved connections
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseConnection -ClearAllConnections
```

Clears all saved named connections and cached authentication tokens. This removes all connection metadata and MSAL token cache files.

### Example 21: Use connection string
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -ConnectionString "AuthType=OAuth;Url=https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com;ClientId=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc;ClientSecret=mysecret"
```

Gets a connection to MYORG using a Dataverse SDK connection string. The connection string contains all necessary authentication information including the URL, so no separate -Url parameter is needed. This is useful for scenarios where connection details are stored in configuration files or environment variables as a single string. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/xrm-tooling/use-connection-strings-xrm-tooling-connect for more information on connection string syntax.

### Example 22: Use PAC CLI profile
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -FromPac
```

Connects to Dataverse using the current Power Platform CLI (PAC) authentication profile. This leverages the authentication you've already established with `pac auth create` and will use the currently selected environment (set via `pac org select`).

### Example 23: Use specific PAC CLI profile by name or index
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -FromPac -Profile "MyDevProfile"
```

Connects to Dataverse using a specific named PAC CLI profile. The profile name must match one of the profiles created with `pac auth create --name <profilename>`. Alternatively, you can specify the index of the profile (e.g., "0" for the first profile).

### Example 24: Disable affinity cookie for maximum performance
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -ClientId "3004eb1e-7a00-45e0-a1dc-6703735eac18" -ClientSecret "itsasecret" -DisableAffinityCookie
```

Connects to MYORG with affinity cookie disabled for maximum performance. This allows each call to Dataverse to be routed to any available server node, which can improve performance in parallel operations. However, this may result in eventual consistency issues where recently created or updated data may not be immediately visible on subsequent requests.

### Example 25: Using parallelization without DisableAffinityCookie (will show warning)
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -Interactive
PS C:\> Get-DataverseRecord -Connection $c -TableName account -Top 1000 | Set-DataverseRecord -Connection $c -TableName account -MaxDegreeOfParallelism 4
WARNING: Using parallelization with affinity cookie enabled may reduce performance. Consider using Get-DataverseConnection with -DisableAffinityCookie for better parallel performance. Note: Disabling affinity cookie may result in eventual consistency issues.
```

When using parallelization with MaxDegreeOfParallelism > 1, the cmdlets will emit a warning if affinity cookie is enabled (the default). This is because affinity cookie prefers routing all requests to the same server node, which can reduce parallel performance.

### Example 26: Using parallelization with DisableAffinityCookie (optimal for performance)
```powershell
PS C:\> $c = Get-DataverseConnection -Url https://myorg.crm11.dynamics.com -Interactive -DisableAffinityCookie
PS C:\> Get-DataverseRecord -Connection $c -TableName account -Top 1000 | Set-DataverseRecord -Connection $c -TableName account -MaxDegreeOfParallelism 4
```

When using parallelization with DisableAffinityCookie, the cmdlets will NOT emit a warning. Each parallel worker can be routed to any available server node, maximizing throughput. Note that this may result in eventual consistency where data updated by one worker may not be immediately visible to another worker.
