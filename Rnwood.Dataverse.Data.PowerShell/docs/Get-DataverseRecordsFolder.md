# Get-DataverseRecordsFolder

## SYNOPSIS
Reads a folder of JSON files written out by `Set-DataverseRecordFolder` and converts back into a stream of PS objects.
Together these commands can be used to extract and import data to and from files, for instance for inclusion in source control, or build/deployment assets.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-DataverseRecordsFolder [-InputPath] <String> [-deletions] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This helper cmdlet reads JSON files from a folder (typically created by Set-DataverseRecordsFolder) and emits them as PowerShell objects to the pipeline.

Each JSON file in the folder is deserialized into a PowerShell object. This is useful for:
- Reading data from source control
- Importing data during build/deployment
- Testing scenarios

When used with the `-deletions` switch, it reads from the 'deletions' subfolder instead, which contains records that were present in a previous export but are no longer present.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseRecordsFolder -InputPath data/contacts | Set-DataverseRecord -connection $c
```

Reads files from `data/contacts` and uses them to create/update records in Dataverse using the existing connection `$c`.
See documentation for `Set-DataverseRecord` as there are option to control how/if existing records will be matched and updated.
