# Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes a relationship from Dataverse.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata [-SchemaName] <String> [-EntityName <String>]
 [-Connection <ServiceClient>] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata` cmdlet permanently deletes a relationship from Dataverse. This affects both OneToMany (1:N) and ManyToMany (N:N) relationships.

**For OneToMany relationships:**
- Deletes the relationship definition
- Deletes the lookup attribute on the referencing entity
- Removes relationship navigation from both entities
- May delete related records depending on cascade delete settings

**For ManyToMany relationships:**
- Deletes the relationship definition
- Deletes the intersect entity and all association records
- Removes relationship navigation from both entities

**?? WARNING: This is a destructive operation!**
- For 1:N relationships with cascade delete, related records may be deleted
- For N:N relationships, all association records in the intersect table are deleted
- The operation cannot be undone

By default, this cmdlet prompts for confirmation (ConfirmImpact = High). Use `-Force` to suppress the confirmation prompt.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete a OneToMany relationship
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_project_contact

Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing the operation "Delete relationship 'new_project_contact'" on target "Dataverse organization".
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
```

Deletes the OneToMany relationship `new_project_contact` after prompting for confirmation.

### Example 2: Delete a ManyToMany relationship without confirmation
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_project_contact_association -Force
```

Deletes a ManyToMany relationship without prompting. All association records are deleted.

### Example 3: Delete relationship with entity name for cache invalidation
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_project_task `
    -EntityName new_project -Force
```

Deletes a relationship and invalidates the metadata cache for the `new_project` entity.

### Example 4: Use WhatIf to preview deletion
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_test_relationship -WhatIf

What if: Performing the operation "Delete relationship 'new_test_relationship'" on target "Dataverse organization".
```

Shows what would happen without actually deleting the relationship.

### Example 5: Delete multiple test relationships
```powershell
PS C:\> @("new_test_rel1", "new_test_rel2", "new_test_rel3") | 
    Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -Force
```

Deletes multiple relationships by passing relationship names through the pipeline.

### Example 6: Find and delete relationships for an entity
```powershell
PS C:\> $relationships = Get-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -EntityName new_customentity

PS C:\> $relationships | Where-Object { $_.SchemaName -like "new_test*" } | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Deleting relationship: $($_.SchemaName)"
    Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName $_.SchemaName -Force
}
```

Finds and deletes all test relationships (starting with "new_test") for an entity.

### Example 7: Conditional deletion based on usage
```powershell
PS C:\> $rel = Get-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_project_contact

PS C:\> if ($rel.RelationshipType -eq "ManyToMany") {
    # Check if there are any associations
    $query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as Count FROM $($rel.IntersectEntityName)"
    $count = (Invoke-DataverseSql -Sql $query).Count
    
    if ($count -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "No associations found, safe to delete"
        Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_project_contact -Force
    } else {
        Write-Warning "Relationship has $count associations. Review before deletion."
    }
}
```

Checks if a ManyToMany relationship has any associations before deleting.

### Example 8: Delete with error handling
```powershell
PS C:\> try {
    Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName new_obsolete_rel `
        -Force -ErrorAction Stop
    Write-Host "Relationship deleted successfully"
    
    # Publish customizations after deletion
    Invoke-DataversePublishAllXml
    Write-Host "Customizations published"
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to delete relationship: $($_.Exception.Message)"
}
```

Deletes a relationship with proper error handling and publishes customizations.

### Example 9: Delete all custom relationships for cleanup
```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DataverseRelationshipMetadata | 
    Where-Object { $_.IsCustomRelationship -and $_.SchemaName -like "new_*" } |
    ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host "Deleting $($_.SchemaName) ($($_.RelationshipType))..."
        try {
            Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -SchemaName $_.SchemaName `
                -Force -ErrorAction Stop
            Write-Host "  Deleted successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
        } catch {
            Write-Warning "  Could not delete: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        }
    }
```

Finds and attempts to delete all custom relationships, handling errors for dependencies.

### Example 10: Use specific connection
```powershell
PS C:\> $conn = Get-DataverseConnection -Url "https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com" -Interactive
PS C:\> Remove-DataverseRelationshipMetadata -Connection $conn `
    -SchemaName new_deprecated_rel -Force
```

Deletes a relationship using a specific connection.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

**Note:** This cmdlet has ConfirmImpact = High, so confirmation is required by default unless `-Force` or `-Confirm:$false` is specified.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Connection
DataverseConnection instance obtained from Get-DataverseConnection cmdlet, or string specifying Dataverse organization URL (e.g. http://server.com/MyOrg/).

If not provided, uses the default connection set via `Get-DataverseConnection -SetAsDefault`.

```yaml
Type: ServiceClient
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -EntityName
Entity name involved in the relationship (for cache invalidation). This is optional but recommended to ensure the metadata cache is properly invalidated for the affected entity.

If not specified, the cmdlet will still delete the relationship but may not invalidate the cache optimally.

You can find relationship schema names using `Get-DataverseRelationshipMetadata`.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
